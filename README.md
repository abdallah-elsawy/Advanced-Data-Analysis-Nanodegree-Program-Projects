# Advanced-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree-Program-Projects
This program prepares you for a career as a data analyst by helping you learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. Youâ€™ll develop proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as you build a portfolio of projects to showcase in your job search. Depending on how quickly you work through the material, the amount of time required is variable. We have included an hourly estimation for each section of the program. The program covers one term of three month (approx. 13 weeks). If you spend about 10 hours per week working through the program, you should finish the term within 13 weeks. Students will have an additional four weeks beyond the end of the term to complete all projects. In order to succeed in this program, we recommend having experience working with data in Python (Numpy and Pandas) and SQL.
